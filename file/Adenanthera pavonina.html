Ripened pods<br />remain on the tree for long periods, sometimes until the following spring.<br />The name &lsquo;Adenanthera&rsquo; is derived from a combination of the Greek<br />words &lsquo;aden&rsquo;, a gland, and &lsquo;anthera&rsquo;, anther, alluding to the anther&rsquo;s<br />characteristics of being tipped and having a deciduous gland.<br />BIOLOGY<br />Most Adenanthera species are deciduous but are leafless for only a few<br />days. They have been observed to be flowering and fruiting almost<br />throughout the year, though for short intervals. Inflorescence appears at<br />the apex of the small fruit. Seeds are probably eaten and dispersed by<br />birds.</p>
